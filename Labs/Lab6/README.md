# Lab 6
## Node.js and Pystache
### Instructions:
Go to lesson 6 in the GitHub repository. Install Node.js and run hello-world.js, hello.js, and http.js. For each, refresh the webpage to see the server activities. Then, installl Pystache 
and run say_hello.py that uses the template say_hello.mustache. Document your results to your GitHub repository.

## Node.js:
Node.js was already installed on my mac so I was able to start with running the scripts. To do this I executed the following series of commands: 
- `cd ~/iot/lesson6`
- `node hello-world.js` (I pressed ctrl C to exit the server)
- `node hello.js` (I pressed ctrl C to exit the server)
- `node http.js` (I pressed ctrl C to exit the server)
![Node.js terminal code](https://github.com/ardensentak/CPE322/blob/main/Labs/Lab6/lab6images/nodejscode.png)

Each running webpage displayed different server activity. As can be seen in the image above, hello-world.js did not display any server activity. Hello.js responded to a refresh with outputting
"response end call done" and "request end event fired" to the terminal. Lastly, http.js responded with a count of how many times the webpage had been refreshed. 

The following images show what each webpage looked like:

## Pystache:
I installed Pystache on my mac using the command `pip3 install pystache`. Then I executed the following commands in order to 
run say_hello.py that uses the template say_hello.mustache.
- `cd ~/iot/lesson6`
- `cat say_hello.mustache`
- `cat say_hello.py`
- `python3 say_hello.py`

The results of these commands are shown below:

## Summary:
By completing this lab I learned how to run webpages using Node.js and how to use Pystache, which is a Python implementation of Mustache.
