# CPE 322
## Lab 1: GHDL & GTKWave
### Instructions:
Go to the GitHub repository for Digital System Design( 
[DSD GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd.git)
). Navigate to GHDL folder. Install GHDL & GTKWave. Run Half Adder Example and another example such as D Flip Flop or 4-1 Multiplexer. 
Document results on your GitHub repository.

## Summary
In this lab I learned how to install and use GHDL and GTKWave. GHDL and GTKWave are tools used to simulate and debug circuits. GHDL is a compiler that translates VHDL files into machine code, while GTKWave is a visualization tool that can visualize circuit behavior. Note that VHDL is a language used to describe the behavior of digital circuits. These tools can be helpful when designing hardware, performing tests, and documenting and verifying digital systems.
